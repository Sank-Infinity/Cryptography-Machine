# Cryptography-Machine

* The reason behind creating this python program to accure basic idea of cryptograpy.
* This is very simple python program which takes message and encode it and at the same time we could decode it. 
* It contains a CryptoMachine class in which encoder and decoder both methods are present.
* Only we need to give our message it encode with its own unique dictionary pattern and whenever we want to decode that perticular message it decodes it and returns us original message without commiting any changes.
